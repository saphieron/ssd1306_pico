# ssd1306_pico

An attempt to create a small library out of the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK's [example demo](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/84e8d489ca321a4be90ee49e36dc29e5c645da08/i2c/ssd1306_i2c) for controlling SSD1306 based OLED displays.

It is meant to act be used against an I2C wrapper to be independent of the Pico SDK's implementation of it.
